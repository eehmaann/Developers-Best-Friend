It designed to validate both through the client side and through the server.
Bird Leaf does two things per tool  In the lorem generator it will add a feathering
type effect through creating a box shadow, and every paragraph after the first will
start with "Bird Leaf"  
In the random user generator tool it will also feather, but the it will also
make every email come from the company, and have the same email domain.
The highlighting tool will alternate colors displaying the users to make it is easier
to keep them separate. 
It has a highlight feature for users.  The age values will change depending on whether
the is being generater as someone who works for a company or not.  If the person works
then the age minimum is 18 otherwise 6
The subheading on user page will change depending on the number of users to be a more
accurate statement.  It won't generate "users" if it only generates one user.
