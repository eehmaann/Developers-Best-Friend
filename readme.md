start with "Bird Leaf"

make every email come from the company, and have the same email domain.
The highlighting tool will alternate colors displaying the users to make it is easier
to keep them separate. 
It has a highlight feature for users.  The age values will change depending on whether
the is being generater as someone who works for a company or not.  If the person works
then the age minimum is 18 otherwise 6

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
